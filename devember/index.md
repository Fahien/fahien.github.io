I, Antonio Caggiano, will participate to the next [Devember](https://devember.org). My Devember will be [exSocket](https://github.com/Fahien/exsocket). I promise I will program for my Devember for at least an hour, every day of the next December. I will also write a daily public devlog and will make the produced code publicly available on the internet. No matter what, I will keep my promise. **ExSocket** will be a collection of exercises written in _C_ on the [Socket API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_sockets). I will post my devlogs here on this blog and you will find the code on this [github repository](https://github.com/Fahien/exsocket).
