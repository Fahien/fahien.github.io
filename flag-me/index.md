Since I started this blog, I began to wonder what would be the right way to internationalize it. Some people opt to create a dedicated site for each language and some people develop more sophisticated solutions. I made something quite simple: _Flag Me_. [Flag Me](https://wordpress.org/plugins/flag-me) is a _Wordpress Plugin_ which enables you to add a country flag before the title of your posts or pages in the sidebar. This makes it easier for visitors to understand the language in which it is written content.

> If you like the plugin, feel free to support my work [donating via PayPal]({{ site.baseurl }}/donate).

## Installation

1\. Upload the whole directory **flag-me** to the **/wp-content/plugins/** directory; 2\. Activate the plugin through the _Plugins_ menu in WordPress; 3\. Edit your post and pick a language from the _Language Box_.
